# Employee-Burnout-Prediction-using-ML
Employee burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion due to excessive and prolonged stress, negatively impacting well-being and job performance. Recognizing and addressing burnout signs is crucial in today's fast-paced, connected world to maintain employee health.

This project explores using regression techniques to predict employee burnout. By analyzing factors such as workload, mental fatigue, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, we aim to develop a model to identify individuals at risk of burnout. Our goal is to create a predictive tool for organizations to proactively address these risk factors.

Using linear regression, we analyze the relationship between contributing factors and burnout levels. The model's performance metrics—Mean Squared Error (0.0032), Root Mean Squared Error (0.0562), Mean Absolute Error (0.0459), and R-squared Score (0.9188)—demonstrate strong predictive capabilities.

Identifying at-risk employees allows organizations to implement targeted interventions, such as workload adjustments, mental health support, and work-life balance initiatives, preventing burnout. This proactive approach enhances employee well-being and boosts productivity and job satisfaction.

In conclusion, predicting employee burnout using regression techniques offers valuable insights for organizations to mitigate burnout risks and promote a healthier, more productive work environment.
